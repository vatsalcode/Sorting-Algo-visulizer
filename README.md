# Sorting-Visualiser

We often use various applications of sorting algorithms in programming functions. To let them understand more efficiently, we should know how things are done with a variable set. Sorting visualizer provides us an imitation of the actual process while executing a sorting algorithm. So in a nutshell

"Sorting visualizer is a simulator of various sorting algorithms."



Here we are visualizing sorting algorithms, using the **matplotlib library.**





Algorithms covererd in this project are :



|     Name        | Function Name   |
| -------------   | -------------   |
| Selection Sort  |  selection_sort |
| Insertion Sort  |  insertion_sort |
| Merge Sort      |  merge_sort     |
| Quick Sort      |  quick_sort     |
| Bubble Sort     |  bubble_sort    |
| Heap Sort       |  heap_sort      |


# How to use



**Install**

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Run**

```
python main.py function_name
```



Pass function name as a command line argument from list of functions above (in all lower case and spaces replaced by underscore).



**for example :**

```
python main.py quick_sort
```
